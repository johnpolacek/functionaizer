## Running Functionaizer Locally

After downloading the project files, install the dependencies.

You will need to create a `.env.local` file at the top-level of your project and with your Open AI Key included as an environment variable in this format:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-youropenaikey
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
